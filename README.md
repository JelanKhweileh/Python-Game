In "Shooting Flappy Birds" the player's objective is to control a flying character and shoot down incoming flappy birds while avoiding 
collisions. The player's score increases with each successfully shot bird, and the game provides the player with three attempts (lives). 
The game ends when the player exhausts all three lives.
